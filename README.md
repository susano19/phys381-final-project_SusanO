Final Project: 2024 MLB Pitching Statistics and Outcomes

This report examined pitches of the 2024 MLB season. It includes a review of the physics of pitching and some summary information on pitch types. It also provides analysis for pitch types used and their outcomes (hit, strike, etc.). The Magnus effect will be approximated by the available data, using the formula F_magnus = 1/2*rho*A*C_L*v^2, where rho is air density, A is the cross sectional area of the baseball,C_L is the lift coefficient, and v is the velocity of the ball. Additional analysis will relate the magnus effect to pitch type. The statistical analysis used actual data and was performed in R using Posit.Cloud.
