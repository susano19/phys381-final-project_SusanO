Final Project: 2024 MLB Pitching Statistics and Outcomes

This report will examine pitches of the 2024 MLB season. It includes a review of the physics of pitching in general and variations across different pitch types. Then it will provide summary statistics for the types of pitches used and their outcomes (hit, strike, etc.), in the 2024 MLB season. Lastly, this report will discuss statistical relationships between types of pitching and outcomes. The statistical analysis of actual data was performed in R using Posit.Cloud.
