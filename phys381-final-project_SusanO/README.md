Not sure why I have a file with the same project name but you can ignore everything in this folder!!



Write a short description of your final project idea. Include: 
1. What you plan to simulate or analyze 
2. What physics concepts are involved - 
3. What tools youâ€™ll use (e.g., Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
